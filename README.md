# GitHub Action to Trigger a Deployment on DeployHQ with a Webhook URL ðŸš€

This action calls the DeployHQ's [Webhook URL](https://www.deployhq.com/support/deployments/automatic-deployments/custom) created for your DeployHQ account to trigger a deployment on DeployHQ. 

## Usage

All sensitive variables should be [set as encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) in the action's configuration.

### Configuration Variables

| Key                        | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Suggested Type | Required |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------- | ------------- |
| `DEPLOYHQ_WEBHOOK_URL`     | **Required.** Your DeployHQ webhook URL. Can be found in your DeployHQ Dashboard, under "Automatic Deployments"                                                                                                               | `secret` | **Yes** |
| `REPO_REVISION`            | The revision you wish to deploy. Can also be set to "latest" if you wish to deploy the latest revision in your set branch. If not set, the default value is "latest".                                                         | `secret` | **No** |
| `REPO_BRANCH`              | The branch your revision is on. If not set, the default value is set to "main".                                                                                                                                               | `secret` | **No** |
| `DEPLOYHQ_EMAIL`           | **Required.** Your DeployHQ user. For example, matias@barilla.com.                                                                                                                                                            | `secret` | **Yes** |
| `REPO_CLONE_URL`           | The path to your repository (as entered in the Deploy UI). If not set, it will be generated with [GitHub Action's default environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables). Nonetheless, we highly recommend setting this variable to avoid unexpected results.          | `secret` | **No** |
